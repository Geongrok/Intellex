# Intellex

**Intellex** is an AI-assisted technical research chatbot that searches a local knowledge base first, uses AeroCalc for explicit aerospace calculations, and falls back to web search when the local database cannot answer the question.

**Every question is independent. Intellex does not use previous chat messages as hidden context for retrieval or answering.**

## Features

- PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT, Markdown and CSV ingestion.
- BM25 + ChromaDB retrieval.
- Database-first answer routing.
- Relevance filtering to reduce false database matches.
- Sentence-fragment protection for badly split document chunks.
- AeroCalc integration for explicit numerical aerospace calculations.
- Web-search fallback.
- OpenRouter support for higher-quality answer generation.
- Ollama/OpenAI support remains available through environment variables.
- Free extractive fallback when no LLM key is configured.
- MathJax rendering for engineering equations.
- Expandable database and web source cards.
- Responsive desktop/mobile UI.
- Server-side API-key handling.
- Basic server-side rate limiting for public deployments.

```

The separate React/Vite frontend and standalone AeroCalc web server are intentionally not included. Intellex uses one FastAPI process and one static UI, which makes the repository smaller and easier to deploy.

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the API key

Copy:

```text
.env.example
```

to:

```text
.env
```

Then put the real key in `.env`:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

**Never put the real key in Python, JavaScript, HTML, or GitHub source files.**

### 4. Start Intellex

```bash
python run_web.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 🔐 API-key security

The API key is intentionally read only by the Python backend:

```python
os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
```

The browser communicates only with:

```text
POST /api/chat
```

The key is never returned to the browser and is never inserted into the frontend JavaScript.

### Important

If a real API key was ever committed to GitHub, **do not simply delete the line and reuse the key**. Revoke/rotate that key at the provider first, then remove the old secret from Git history.

The repository includes:

```text
.gitignore
```

with:

```text
.env
```

so the local secret file is not accidentally committed.

### Public deployment

Hiding the key protects it from being copied by visitors, but a public backend can still be abused: someone could repeatedly call `/api/chat` and make your server spend your API credits.

Intellex therefore includes lightweight server-side controls:

- per-client chat rate limit
- rebuild cooldown
- provider keys remain server-side

For a serious public deployment, also use a reverse proxy/WAF and provider-side spending limits.

## Knowledge base

The distributed `cache/` contains the current prebuilt index.

To create a new knowledge base, place source documents in:

```text
data/
```

and rebuild the index:

```text
POST /api/rebuild
```

or use the **Rebuild Index** button in the UI.

Supported source formats include:

```text
.pdf
.docx
.pptx
.xlsx
.txt
.md
.csv
```

Images can also be processed when the optional OCR dependencies are available.

## Answer routing

Intellex deliberately avoids letting AeroCalc hijack ordinary questions.

For example:

```text
What is Mach number?
```

is treated as a knowledge question.

Whereas:

```text
Calculate the speed of sound at 11,000 m.
```

can be routed to AeroCalc if the database does not contain a sufficiently relevant answer.

The intended priority is:

**Database → AeroCalc for genuine calculations → Web**

## Source presentation

Answers are displayed first.

Sources are separated into expandable cards:

```text
📚 Database sources  5  ⌄
🌐 Web sources       5  ⌄
```

This keeps raw retrieval snippets from overwhelming the actual answer.

## API

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Intellex UI |
| `/api/health` | GET | Backend/index status |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Ask an independent question |
| `/api/rebuild` | POST | Rebuild the local index |

Example:

```json
{
  "message": "What is Mach number?"
}
```

## Deployment

For local development:

```text
Browser → localhost:8000 → FastAPI → Intellex
```

For a hosted deployment:

```text
Browser
   │
   ▼
HTTPS / reverse proxy
   │
   ▼
FastAPI
   ├── local knowledge index
   ├── AeroCalc
   ├── LLM provider
   └── web search
```

GitHub stores the **source code**; it does not execute the Python backend.

## Notes

This is a personal research/development project. AI-generated answers and engineering calculations should be independently verified before being used for safety-critical or formal engineering decisions.
